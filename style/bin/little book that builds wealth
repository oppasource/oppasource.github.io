Buy company with moats(ability of a company to take down its competitors in long run)

Great products, great size, great execution, and great management......are good for a company but not moats(long term)

Four main points to look for a company with moats
	-Intangible assets (not physicial assets - patents, copyrights, regulatory licenses, brands)
	-Customer switching costs (products/services sold by company will be difficult to switch by consumers)
	-Network Economics (business increases with increase number of users, e.g. credit card network keeps spearding)
	-Cost advantage (Some unique benefit like location, access to unique asset, etc which allow to give better service than competitors)


Steps to analyse a company for moat:
1. See the gains on capital in past for a company (if no gains, see if company has anything new coming up in future or else its a no moat.)

2. After gains detected, see why are gains so high, check for advantages over other competitors (patents, network, switching cost,etc)

3. How strong are those competative advantages.

Based on all above steps, classify a company with no-moat, narrow-moat, wide-moat.
narrow-moat indicating weak, wide-moat indicating strong.
